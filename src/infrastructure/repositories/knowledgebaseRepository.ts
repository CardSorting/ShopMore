# Card Condition Guide

To ensure you know exactly what you are buying, we use a standardized grading system for all single cards.

## Near Mint (NM)
Cards in Near Mint condition show minimal to no wear from shuffling or play. They may have a tiny speck or two but are generally indistinguishable from cards fresh out of a pack.

## Lightly Played (LP)
Lightly Played cards may have minor border or corner wear, or small scratches/scuffs. There are no major defects like creases or water damage.

## Moderately Played (MP)
Moderately Played cards show significant wear. Border and corner wear are obvious, and there may be some whitening or minor surface damage.

## Heavily Played (HP)
Heavily Played cards show severe wear but are still tournament legal in a sleeve. They may have creases or heavy whitening.

### Authenticity Guarantee
All cards are inspected by our experts to guarantee 100% authenticity.
