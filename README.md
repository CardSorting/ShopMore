## 🏗 Architecture (Joy-Zoning)

ShopMore adheres to a strict layered architecture (Clean Architecture / DDD) to ensure business logic remains pure, testable, and decoupled from infrastructure.

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain** | `src/domain/` | Pure business logic: models, rules, and repository contracts. **Zero dependencies.** |
| **Core** | `src/core/` | Application orchestration: services coordinate domain logic and infrastructure adapters. |
| **Infrastructure** | `src/infrastructure/` | Adapters for SQLite, API-backed services, and payment processors. |
| **UI** | `src/ui/` | React 19 components, Next.js pages, and high-fidelity layouts. |
| **Plumbing** | `src/utils/` | Stateless helpers, formatters, and global constants. |
