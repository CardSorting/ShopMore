## ✅ Industrialized Modules

### 1. Support CRM (Interaction Hardening)
- **Agent Collision**: Real-time heartbeat mechanism prevents response overlap.
- **Macros**: Pre-defined response templates with dynamic variable injection.
- **Audit Logging**: Full traceability for all ticket status changes and internal notes.

### 2. Digital Vault (Asset Hardening)
- **Streaming Ingestion**: Memory-efficient processing for massive file uploads.
- **Secure Locker**: Ephemeral, authenticated download links for customers.
- **Atomic Fulfillment**: Digital ownership is assigned atomically upon payment confirmation.

### 3. SEO & Routing (Discovery Hardening)
- **Canonical Handles**: High-integrity URL generation via `TaxonomyService`.
- **Crawler Guidance**: Automated `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` orchestration.
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD injection for Product and Breadcrumb rich snippets.

## 🏗️ Architectural Compliance (Joy-Zoning)

The engine has been audited for compliance with the 4-layer Joy-Zoning architecture:

1. **Domain (Pure)**: All business rules (Validation, Status Transitions, Cart Calculations) are pure TypeScript. Verified zero I/O leakage.
2. **Core (Orchestrated)**: Services coordiate domain rules and infrastructure adapters. Dependency injection verified via `container.ts`.
3. **Infrastructure (Isolated)**: Concrete adapters for SQLite, Stripe, and Auth are isolated from business logic.
4. **UI (Predictable)**: React components consume the client-side API facade, ensuring a consistent request lifecycle.

## 📋 Operational Readiness

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Secret Rotation**: Rotate `SESSION_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters).
- [ ] **Rate Limits**: Tune `apiGuards.ts` buckets for production traffic levels.
- [ ] **Backup Policy**: Establish cron job for `DreamBees.db` snapshots.
- [ ] **Stripe Production**: Switch `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to live mode.

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Audit Service**: Monitor `src/core/AuditService.ts` logs for high-risk operations.
- **Performance**: Track Next.js Vitals and SQLite query latency.
- **Security**: Monitor `UnauthorizedError` and `RateLimitError` spikes in production logs.
